# Networking module

This module provides the networking glue between the sibling [executors](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/sourcegraph/executors/aws/3.42.0/submodules/executors) and [docker-mirror](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/sourcegraph/executors/aws/3.42.0/submodules/docker-mirror) modules.

_(There's very little to talk about in here.)_
